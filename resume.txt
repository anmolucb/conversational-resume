My Journey as a Data-Driven Analytics Leader

My name is Anmol Gupta, and I’m based in Bangalore, India. With a deep-rooted passion for data, I’ve built a career around transforming complex datasets into meaningful business insights that drive growth and operational excellence. I hold a Master of Analytics degree from the University of California, Berkeley (2022 to 2023) (completed and graduated in 2023) , and a Bachelor's in Industrial Engineering and Management from R.V. College of Engineering (2017 to 2021).

My professional identity is grounded in being a data-driven Business Intelligence and Analytics expert. I specialize in building scalable ETL pipelines, designing intuitive dashboards, conducting A/B testing, and automating CRM and operational workflows. My strength lies in translating data into actionable insights that generate measurable business impact.

My Experience at DevRev (currently working here)
Currently, I serve as a Member of Technical Staff – Grow Analytics at DevRev. Since joining DevRev in 2023, I have led several initiatives that significantly enhanced operational efficiency and data-driven decision-making across the organization.

One of my most impactful contributions at DevRev was developing a custom lead attribution model coupled with a real-time ROI dashboard, resulting in $15,000 in quarterly savings. I also built scalable ETL pipelines that improved query performance by 40%, launched sales dashboards that saved over 30 hours per week in manual effort, and designed opportunity metrics that accelerated deal closures by 20% while boosting win rates by 10%.

To further refine our marketing strategy at DevRev, I created a comprehensive website activity tracking system that improved A/B testing effectiveness and reduced user drop-offs by 10%. This work led to a patent filing. Additionally, I automated CRM workflows, enhancing operational efficiency by 35%, and led a data hygiene project where I removed over 20,000 duplicate records and analyzed 1,500 orphan accounts to improve CRM accuracy.

Earlier Experience in Product Management at Kuliza (worked here from 2021 to 2022)
Before transitioning to analytics, I worked as an Associate Product Manager at Kuliza from 2021 to 2022. I led the development of a pre configured loan workflow engine at Kuliza that cut configuration costs by 70% and accelerated adoption through analytics-informed product development. I also designed a scalable onboarding and training program that reduced ramp-up time by three weeks, and I implemented a closed-loop feedback system with clients that increased user satisfaction by 30% while decreasing support tickets.

My Technical Skill Set
I’m proficient in BI tools like Looker Studio and Tableau. My programming expertise includes Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels), SQL (across Redshift, Oracle, NoSQL), and R. I have hands-on experience in ETL, data warehousing, and modeling, along with statistical techniques such as regression, classification, clustering, and neural networks. My cloud and big data skills include AWS (Redshift, S3, DynamoDB, EC2), and I regularly work with agile methodologies, A/B testing, and CRM automation.

Impact Through Innovation and Action
Throughout my journey, I've consistently taken the initiative to solve problems beyond my immediate responsibilities. For instance, at DevRev when sales reps struggled with CRM data quality at DevRev, I built Python scripts to deduplicate 20,000+ records and applied anomaly detection to 1,500 orphan accounts. This improved CRM accuracy by 25% and enhanced pipeline visibility.

Another time at Devrev our marketing team urgently needed a dashboard to show real-time ROI across campaigns and channels. Despite a tight two-week deadline, I built an attribution model and an interactive Looker Studio dashboard within ten days. This enabled a strategic shift that led to $15K in quarterly savings.

At Kuliza, where I worked as a product manager, I addressed client complaints about slow onboarding for digital loan workflows. I led the development of a modular and configurable engine, reduced hardcoded dependencies, and designed training templates. This reduced setup time from weeks to just four days and improved customer satisfaction by 30%.

One of my proudest innovations was at DevRev, where I built a user activity tracking system from scratch. By designing a robust data model and integrating cookie-based tracking, I enabled the isolation of A/B test groups and cross-page journey stitching. This significantly improved testing effectiveness and user engagement metrics for DevRev.

When urgent pipeline insights were needed mid-quarter in DevRev by sales leadership team, I quickly identified key sales metrics, built a real-time dashboard in Looker using SQL, and initiated weekly insights sharing with leadership. This improved forecasting accuracy and reduced reporting efforts by over 30 man hours weekly.

Who I Am and Where I'm Headed
I identify as a lifelong learner and a goal-oriented professional who thrives on optimizing processes. My core strengths lie in strategic thinking, cross-functional collaboration, and storytelling through data.

I dedicate time to upskill and my current learning goals include deepening my understanding of AWS and cloud-native analytics, mastering production-grade ETL design, and building an AI-powered tools.

Through my journey, I aim to continue solving impactful problems, inventing scalable systems, and delivering measurable value through data.
