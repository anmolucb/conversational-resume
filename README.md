This is an experimental project to explore the applications of LLMs running locally on the browser itself, eliminating the need for purchasing API tokens for accessing LLMs.
I am exploring how LLMs can be used widely using cost effective resources.

In this project, I am exploring the use of RAG based LLMs to make my resume conversational i.e. enable the end user to have a conversation with my resume and get to understand my work experience using natural language.
